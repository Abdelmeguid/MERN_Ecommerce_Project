Certainly! Here's an example of how you can use the `notFound` and `errorHandler` middleware functions in a route file in a MERN project:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { notFound, errorHandler } from './middleware.js';

const router = express.Router();

// Sample route
router.get('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  // Perform some logic
  // ...

  // If the requested resource is not found
  const error = new Error('Requested resource not found');
  next(error);
});

// Register the middleware functions
router.use(notFound);
router.use(errorHandler);

export default router;
```

In this example, we have a sample route defined using `express.Router()`. Inside the route, we simulate a case where the requested resource is not found by creating a new `Error` object and passing it to `next(error)`. This triggers the `notFound` middleware.

In your main server file (e.g., `app.js`), you would import and use this route file:

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import exampleRoute from './routes/example.js';

const app = express();

// Other middleware and configurations
// ...

// Register the example route
app.use('/api/example', exampleRoute);

// Other routes and middleware
// ...

// Error handling middleware
app.use(notFound);
app.use(errorHandler);

// Start the server
app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

By including the `exampleRoute` in your main server file, requests to `/api/example` will go through the defined route and trigger the `notFound` middleware if the requested resource is not found. The `errorHandler` middleware is also registered at the end of your main server file to handle any other encountered errors.

This structure allows you to centralize error handling and provide consistent error responses throughout your MERN project.
